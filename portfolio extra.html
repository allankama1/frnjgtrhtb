    <div class="d-flex">
        <p >  My educational experience includes a recently completed college degree, which contributed greatly to my development of skills such as sales and teamwork. I noticed that the job posting listed these as essential skills for the position. The classes I took and projects I completed were for a marketing major, and they imparted many of the concepts necessary to understanding good sales techniques. I also often worked to complete presentations with classmates, and this helped me hone my ability to collaborate constructively. My educational background has prepared me well for this position and for a successful career path.</p>
